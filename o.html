<h1>Website Opinion Article</h1>
<h3><a href="http://www.espn.com/">ESPN</a></h3>
    <p>ESPN’s website was one that really caught my eye for a number of different reasons. I think that the developer did a great job of making the sight eye catching, while also having relevant information that is easy to find. The scoreboard at the top of the website is what sets in apart and makes it unique as it has live stats that update as games across the nation are going on. They are separated into categories, with the most popular events showing up first. ESPN also has their website set up so that it is very accessible with big headlines that grab the viewers attention. The high-quality pictures and videos make it something to easily focus on. The code for this website looks like it is very modern and seems like it would take years to write because it is so extensive. It uses “DOCTYPE html” which means that it uses the latest HTML5 version which I would come to expect with such a well-done website. It’s hard to imagine writing the code for such a well-designed website, but it has obviously paid off because they attract a lot of traffic being one of the most popular websites in 2018. The navigation throughout this website is smooth and offers little resistance when specifically searching for something and it is laid out in such a way that makes searching for information effortless. Overall, this is one of the best websites that I have visited because they have so much to offer, and give such high-quality pictures, videos, layout, and navigation which makes life easy for the user.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></h3>    
     <p>The second website that really intrigued me was Apple’s website, that is known for their high-tech products. The first thing that caught my eye about this website was the simple or “slick” design that reminds me about the phones they make- simple, sleek, innovative, and impressive. The website seems to have separate tables that different things are grouped in, for example they have different groups that are advertising different phones for different prices. This makes it easy for you to simply find what you are looking for in a quick manner. This website is also very aesthetically pleasing, when scrolling through the website everything flows in a well-uniformed manner that make you want to buy their products just by looking at the website. Very similarly to ESPN’s website, Apple’s code is very extensive and uses “DOCTYPE html" so it is the most up to date version. Right off the bat I notice a lot of links, which must be for the navigation tab at the top of Apple’s website. Once again, I was very impressed by looking through Apple’s website, they did a great job of designing it. </p>

   <p>The third website that I decided to take a look at was definitely not one of the strongest websites that I’ve seen. This really just hurts my brain to look at, nothing is organized, there is no sense of methodology it just looks all squished together and if you find what you’re looking for- great; but if you look away- you will have a tough time finding that item again. There is an index on the far left side of the website, but it is so small compared to the rest of the page, with no easy way to quickly find what you are looking for. It seems like the strategy for this company’s website is that the more information that you have on a website, the better. But as we saw with Apple, there is a way to strategically design your website so that even if you have lot of information, you can make it easier for the viewer by having better organization and a better layout. This websites code reveals that they do not use "DOCTYPE html" so I’m not sure which version of HTML they use, it is not the most up to date version. This does not surprise me, and the code looks to be about as much of a mess as the actual website. Overall, this is not how you want to design your website.</p>
