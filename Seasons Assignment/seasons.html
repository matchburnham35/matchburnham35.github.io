            <h1>The Four Seasons- A Poem</h1>
            <p><img src="download.jpg" class="bgpic">The fields are rich with daffodils,
A coat of clover cloaks the hills,
And I must dance, and I must sing
To see the beauty of the spring.

The earth is warm, the sun's ablaze,
It is a time of carefree days;
And bees abuzz that chance to pass
May see me snoozing in the grass.

The leaves are yellow, red, and brown,
A shower sprinkles softly down;
The air is fragrant, crisp, and cool,
And once again I'm stuck in school.

The birds are gone, the world is white,
The winds are wild, they chill and bite;
The ground is thick with slush and sleet,
And I can barely feel my feet.

The last is done, the next is here,
The same as it is every year;
Spring -- then sunshine ' autumn ' snow,
That is how each year must go.</p>
